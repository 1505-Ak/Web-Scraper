## 📸 How It Works

1. **Upload an image** of a car (e.g., side view).
2. **Model detects and classifies** the vehicle using fine-tuned deep learning models.
3. **Metadata is extracted** (make, model, year, body type).
4. **Structured queries** are generated and sent to web scraping modules.
5. **Top results** from various platforms are returned instantly.
